# CDMO Project Example
  As a preparation for the project proposed for the exam of CDMO, the exercise consists of implementing solutions for VLSI problem. 
  ## CP formulation
    Constraint programming formulation of VLSI problem focusing on:
      * Implied Constraints
      * Symmetry Breaking
      * Search Strategies
  ## SAT formulation
    SAT formulation of VLSI problem focusing on:
      * Encodings
      * Optimizing of SAT solutions
